## Briefly
- The web wrapper is implemented using [Django 2.2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/releases/2.2/).
- [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) is used as a main dataset.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for working with neural networks.
- [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) for ANN search + vector quantization.
- ResNet50 pretrained on [MS1M-Arcface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface#train).
- For **Linux** and **Mac OS**.

## Easy using with Docker [recommended]
1. Build image from Dockerfile
```sh
$ docker build -t l4fimage .
```

2. Run container as daemon and expose 8000 port
```sh
$ docker run -d --name look4face -p 8000:8000 l4fimage
```

## Installation
If you have CUDA installed, all calculations will be performed on the GPU, otherwise - on the CPU.

1. Clone this repository:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sankovalev/Look4Face.git
```

2. Load the [default backbone weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pCY9sfBddk8Mj6HgSSWDz6GHmYAJIdGa) and the [lfw dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZ0w7sVmoIb7jQtVXmJBReVcYz-GfW7v):
- put _Backbone.pth_ into 'backbone' folder
- unpack _dataset.zip_ and replace an empty 'media/media_root/dataset' folder
You may change paths and filenames in Look4Face/Look4Face/settings.py

3. Create virtualenv and activate it:
```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 Look4Face
$ cd Look4Face
$ source bin/activate
```

4. Make sure that you are using python3 & pip3 from virtual environment:
```sh
$ which python3
$ which pip3
```

5. Install all requirements:
```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Start web server
```sh
$ cd Look4Face
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```
7. Open [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) with browser.

### How to use with other data
I strongly recommend to use the [face.evoLVe.PyTorch](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch) repository for train your own models.
1. Put your dataset to Look4Face/dataset with structure:
```
  Look4Face/dataset/your_db/
                      -> id1/
                          -> filename_1.jpg
                          -> ...
                      -> id2/
                          -> filename_1.jpg
                          -> ...
                      -> ...
                          -> ...
                          -> ...
  ```
and set variable in Look4Face/Look4Face/settings.py:
```python
DATASET_FOLDER = 'your_db'
```
2. Similarly, put your Faiss index and meta information for labels (dict with pairs id:PersonName) to the same folder, set variables:
```python
DATASET_INDEX = 'your_index.bin'
DATASET_LABELS = 'your_labels.pkl'
```
3. Update Backbone.pth if you need:
```
  Look4Face/backbone/
                     -> your_backbone.pth
  ```
and set variable in Look4Face/Look4Face/settings.py:
```python
BACKBONE_FILE = 'your_backbone.pth'
```

 - Write notification if there are no faces on photo.
 - Write tutorial about using own dataset.
